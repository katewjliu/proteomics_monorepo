# CPTAC data download project
This Python-based application connects to CPTAC public data repository to fetch project and study information as well as download URL via their GraphQL API (https://proteomic.datacommons.cancer.gov/pdc/api-documentation). It creates a SQLite database for this metadata information. Users of this API can query the DB to retrieve file names based on file size (e.g. smallest, largest, or in size range). Users can also start file downloading in parallel threads and monitor file downloading progress on HTML webpage. Overall this project code provides a way to download files from CPTAC programmatically via their API and store file metadata information in a database for future query.
